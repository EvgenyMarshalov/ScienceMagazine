                    <p>Science Magazine is a peer-reviewed bimonthly journal that publishes original research papers on all aspects of power engineering (production, transmission and consumption of electricity and heat). Issues of mathematical modeling, IT support and economic analysis in power engineering are also in the scope of our journal. Both experimental and theoretical studies are accepted with preference to those concerning energy saving and ecology issues.</p>
